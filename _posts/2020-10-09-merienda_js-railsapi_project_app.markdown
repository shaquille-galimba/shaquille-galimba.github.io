The last time I made a blog for my project it was all technical and I mean TECHNICAL, because it's about how to speed the database query using the include method on rails. So, now I just want to talk about how did I come up with my idea on this JavaScript - Rails project.

The term "Merienda" is derived from the Tagalog word "Meryenda" which just means "afternoon snacks" in English. During this pandemic, a lot of my friends from the Philippines either lost their job or just had some extra time due to working from home. As a result, some of them resorted to sell foods online as a business and I really want to support them as much as I could. 

While I cannot make an e-commerce type of website, I'm pretty sure I could make an application that promotes their stores by providing their collective store's information. The goal is to make them share my website through their store pages so that anyone who visits it not only see the sharer's store but also my other friends' stores.

I live in America so it's no secret that I've also been affected by this current pandemic, but this phenomenon has a greater impact on those people who lives in a 3rd world country like the Philippines. So, I really hope that this application I'm working on could give my friends' businesses a lot of help to gain their success.
