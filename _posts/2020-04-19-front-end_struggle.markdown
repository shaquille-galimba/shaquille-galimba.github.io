I find learning CSS harder than other previous concept I've learned. Designing through CSS is not as simple as it sounds, because you have to learn a ton of things before you could ever finish just one functioning and responsive website. However, I find that there's also a lot of ways to do one same thing in CSS that's why I just have to find where am I the most comfortable.

I am not the most creative person (artwise), that's why I decided to set my mind to style through CSS the logical way. What I mean is I have to take it step-by-step:

1. Finish the markup (HTML)
2. Decide which display style is the most appropriate for the website I am making. However, I'm looking to try and use CSS grid as my main display style because of how flexible it could be but I know it can't always be the best option.
3. Decide if you want to make your website a "Mobile first" or "Desktop first"
4. Group the content of the website as organize as possible and give the most logical name to a class or ID if it may be.
5. Design with CSS.
6. Make media queries for the website to be responsive no matter what device it's being used.
7. Clean codes inside HTML and CSS file and write comments if necessary for it to be readable by other people.

There we have it, my step-by-step plan on working with CSS. I will try to keep those in mind so, there's at least some structure in my head while making a website.

I hope this will help someone to be organize, I know it's not that well-thought because I'm just writing this from the top of my head, but I have to exhale all the thoughts in my mind for it to be clearer to me. So, I guess I need this more than any other people.

Happy coding!
