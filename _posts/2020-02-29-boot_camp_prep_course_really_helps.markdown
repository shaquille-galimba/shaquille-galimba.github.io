My self-paced program started in February 10, and just 2 weeks later I found myself knocking on the doors of the first of five major projects. I just finished Module 6: Section 15: Scraping, then told myself I should right another blog but the blog suggestion says I should try to write about Module 5: Section 9 which I can't even remember when I finished. 

I'm not writing this to brag or anything, but to just say that finishing the boot camp prep course offered before you start the real thing helps me to go through some topics with ease. Sure, you technically get almost twice the time just finishing the same lessons tackled in the prep course and the boot camp itself, but keep in mind that when doing the prep course there is no pressure of time, so you will be able to take the lessons in and actually learn it, compared to when you jump immediately to the actual course where you will have a time table in front of you. 

As a self-paced student I don't see anything wrong with immediately jumping to the actual course, but I can imagine it will be challenging someone that has the same coding experience as me before going to the boot camp prep(which is none) who's a full-time or even part-time student. 

I hope I can keep my current phase throughout the course while also fully understanding what I should. I'm really excited to make the first project and put what I learned from the course so far. My next blog post would probably be something about the project, until then.. let's get it!
