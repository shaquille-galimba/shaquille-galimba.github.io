A not so short introduction to myself, just a guy born and raised in the Philippines. I never finished college but I was an Electronics and Communication Engineering student for more than 4 years until we migrated here in the US. Never had the chance to go back to Engineering school here because the expenses are a fold higher back when I was in the Philippines, so I decided to find a job and found a job, I did! Currently working at a very well-known bank and I would never want to leave this job if it weren't for my sudden obsession to learn about coding and also I feel like I'm merely using my brain's full capacity at this job.

I always have so much time to spend outside of my current job but as I wasn't from here originally, so I just spent it playing video games. Being a gamer for such a long time, a question just pops into my head out of nowhere, "How do they make this games?" and like a real human being, I googled it. There starts my journey, ended up coding along a website that teaches you how to make a very simple RPG game using C# and one thing led to another I found myself learning JavaScript through some free resources around the whole world wide web.

When I was an Engineering student I've took an "Introduction to programming" course, it wasn't one of our majors but I remembered that I really enjoyed the experience it gives me when I was coding that time because given that we are engineering students, they are more focused on teaching us the logical side of coding. Knowing myself as a very logical and analytical person I realized that I should give this new "hobby" a chance to become a profession.

I'm really excited for this new adventure that I'm taking and how would Flatiron school help me shape myself into someone I would be proud of.
